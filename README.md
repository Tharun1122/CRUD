## 🗃️ CRUD Operations Explained

| Operation | Route                        | Description                                                                 |
|----------:|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Create** | `/add`                       | Add a new movie via a form. Poster image can be uploaded (optional).       |
| **Read**   | `/`                          | Homepage displays a list of all movies in the database.                    |
| **Update** | `/edit/<int:id>`             | Edit any movie's details and update its poster image if needed.            |
| **Delete** | `/delete/<int:id>` _(POST)_ | Delete a movie and remove its associated poster image from the disk.       |

## 🌐 Poster Fetching (OMDb API)

- If a movie does not have a poster uploaded, you can fetch it using:
  - The `/fetch_posters` route in the app.
  - The standalone script `img.py`.
- Posters are fetched by querying OMDb API using the movie title.
- Downloaded posters are saved in the `uploads/` folder as `<id>.jpg`.
